// // Avoiding Global Scope Pollution:

// Variables declared inside the IIFE are not added to the global scope. This helps in preventing naming conflicts with other scripts and libraries.
// Encapsulation:

// It allows encapsulation of variables. Variables declared inside the IIFE are not accessible from the outside, providing a level of privacy.
// Isolation:

// It helps in isolating code. Variables declared inside the IIFE do not interfere with variables in the outer scope, and vice versa.
// Module Pattern:

// IIFE is often used in creating a module pattern, allowing the creation of private and public methods within the same scope.
// Avoiding Hoisting Issues:

// By using a function expression, you avoid hoisting issues that can occur with function declarations.
// Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) - Named IIFE
(function chai() {
    console.log(`DB connected`);
})();
// Output: DB connected

// If two IIFE are used, it's a good practice to end each with a semicolon to avoid potential issues.

// Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) - Unnamed IIFE
(
    (name) => {
        console.log(`DB connected ${name}`);
    }
)('Postgres');
// Output: DB connected Postgres

// Explanation:
// - The first IIFE is named 'chai' and logs "DB connected" immediately when the script runs.
// - The second IIFE is unnamed and takes a parameter 'name',  followed by the provided name ('Postgres').
// - Both IIFE syntaxes are valid, and the use of parentheses around the function helps to indicate that it's a function expression being invoked immediately.

// Note: Ending IIFE with semicolons is especially important when you are combining multiple JavaScript files into one, to prevent unexpected issues due to automatic semicolon insertion.
